CMB_Anomalies_in_Standard_Model:

  unresolved_issues:
    - "Axis of Evil: Preferred alignment of multipoles"
    - "Cold Spot: Unusually large cold region"
    - "Hemispherical asymmetry: Power differences between hemispheres"
    - "Quadrupole-octopole alignment: Unexpected correlations"
    - "Spectral distortions: Small but significant deviations from perfect blackbody"

  standard_explanations:
    - "Cosmic variance"
    - "Foreground contamination"
    - "Instrumental effects"
    - "Insufficient data"

APT_Reinterpretation:

   specific_reinterpretations:

     cold_spot:
      standard: "Statistical fluke or unknown physics"
      apt: "**Region of different Praesto impedance/density**"
      mechanism: "**Impedance boundary effect** - different relaxation rate in that direction"
      prediction: "**Should show modified propagation effects for other signals**"

     spectral_distortions:
      standard: "Challenges perfect thermalization"
      apt: "**Impedance-dependent propagation effects**"
      mechanism: "**Frequency-dependent Praesto interaction** during transit"
      prediction: "**Should show specific impedance correlation patterns**"

Connections_to_Other_APT_Elements:

  impedance_mapping:
    - "CMB temperature variations → Praesto density variations"
    - "Polarization patterns → Praesto flow directions"
    - "Frequency spectra → Impedance frequency response"

  time_emergence:
    - "CMB represents a specific entropy state in our region"
    - "Time arrow defined relative to this local thermal state"

    - "**Cross-correlate CMB anomalies with observational galaxy**"
    - "**Search for impedance signatures in CMB spectral distortions**"
    - "**Map CMB polarization against galactic impedance gradients**"
