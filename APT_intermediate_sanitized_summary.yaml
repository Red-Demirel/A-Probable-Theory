  disclaimer: >
    A Probable Theory (APT) does not claim to own truth,
    nor does it aim to replace established physical models.
    Its goal is to improve understanding, suggest alternative
    interpretations, and provide a logically compact substrate
    for further scientific exploration. APT remains a provisional,
    iterative framework whose value depends on empirical adequacy
    and clarity, not authority.

Praesto:
  type: self-referential electrolytic continuum
  extent: spatially infinite
  time: emergent from entropy gradients
  state_variables:
    - ρ_P(x): local density [kg·m⁻³]
    - Z(x): local impedance ∈ (0, ∞) [Ω]
    - v(x): local flow field [m·s⁻¹]
    - Θ_topo(x): topological order [dimensionless]
    - D_env(x): local dynamic baseline [J·m⁻³]
  statistical_output: ⟨Z⟩_V→∞ = Z₀ ≈ 273 Ω
  resistance_principle: motion along minimum-resistance paths

Emergence_Cascade:
  Phase_0_Logic:
    premise: ¬⊥ → ∃L0
    consequence: infinite heterogeneous substrate
  Phase_1_Phase_Transitions:
    - FOG:      ρ_P → 0        → Z ≈ 0        → no structure
    - MIST:     0 < ρ_P < ρ_c  → 0 < Z < Z_th  → wave propagation
    - ELECTROLYTIC: ρ_P ≥ ρ_c  → Z ≥ Z_th     → topology enabled
  Phase_2_Structural_Ladder:
    - 4_MONOMER:  Δρ_P → condensate droplet
    - 5_STRING:   monomers → linear chains via ∇Z alignment
    - 6_KNOT:     strings → closed topologies K(Θ)
    - 7_COMPOSITE: K×3 → quark, K×n → hadron
  Phase_3_Force_Emergence:
    - 8_EM:       single knot spin → ∇Z, ∇×v → Maxwell
    - 9_STRONG:   3-knot tension → confinement
    - 10_WEAK:    K(Θ_i) → K(Θ_f) → topology shift
    - 11_GRAVITY: ΣK → ρ_P sink → vortex inflow → geodesic refraction (RFDG)

Action_Pulse_Dynamics:
  pulse: ΔA_k ≥ ħ [J·s]
  local_rate: τ(x) = τ₀ · (Z/Z₀)^p · (ρ_P/ρ_c)^q [s]
  effective_constants:
    c_eff = c₀ / f_c(Z_r) [m·s⁻¹]

  gravity_link: g_eff = η · F_g(Z_r) + H(Z_r, ∇Z)

Charge_Quantization:
  definition: q = k ∮_S Z · dA [C]
  proof:
    - Stokes: ∮Z·dA = ∫d(Z·dA)
    - dZ ∧ dA = 0 (Z closed for defects)
    - ddA = 0 → integral = topological winding
  conservation: linking number invariant
  prediction: fractional charge impossible

Cosmology:
  model: mini-bang (local ~13.5 Gyr?)
  expansion: ρ_P rarefaction + backreaction
  dark_energy: ⟨Z⟩_∞ decrease + Q_D(entropy) + photon m_eff
  dark_matter: nonlinear Z stiffening + m_eff gradient
  averaging: Buchert impedance-weighted ⟨X⟩ = ∫X·(Z/Z₀)√g d³x / ∫(Z/Z₀)√g d³x
  redshift_interpretation: environmental + expansion + fatigue

Environmental_Dependence:

  fine_structure:
    α(Z,ρ): α₀ · [ρ_P/(ρ_P + ρ_c)] · [1/(1 + κ((Z/Z₀)² - 1))]
    probe: α as diagnostic of local Praesto state
  mass_gradient:
    m_eff ∝ |D_internal - D_environment|
    voids: D_env → min → m_eff ↑ → stronger gravity
    clusters: D_env → max → m_eff ↓ → weaker gravity
  photon_mass:
    m_γ_eff ∝ |∇D| in voids
    analog: Meissner effect → Λ = f(ρ_P, Z)
    propagation: E(x) = E₀ exp(-x/Λ)

Gravity_Mechanism_RFDG:
  source: K(Θ) constraint → ρ_P sink → Z_r max
  flow: ∇ρ_P → minimum-resistance inflow → vortex
  geodesic: g_eff(ρ_r) = η + α ∂ρ ∂ρ
  equation: F(ρ) d²x^μ/dτ² + Γ(ρ)^i_jk dx^j/dτ dx^k/dτ = 0

    connects: "Statistical Topology → Time Direction / Thermodynamic Law"
    claim: "Time = entropy gradient ordering; irreversibility = knot formation/decay statistics."

    claim: "Conservation laws from invariant AP-cycle topology."
  AP_flow_inertial-persistence:
    connects: "Action-Pulse Periodicity → Inertial Persistence"
    claim: "Inertia = continuity of AP-locked flow; eliminates mass-inertia duality."
  local-asymmetry_cosmology:
    connects: "Early Local Fluctuations → Large-Scale Structure"
    claim: "Cosmic structure = fossil entropy-asymmetry patches in infinite Praesto."

  MOND_phenomenology:
    connects: "m_eff Environmental Gradient → MOND Acceleration Scale"
    claim: "MOND's a₀ ≈ 1.2×10⁻¹⁰ m/s² emerges as characteristic scale where m_eff(D_env) transitions between void and cluster regimes."
    mechanism: "m_eff = k_m * |D_internal - D_env| creates apparent force modification at galaxy scales where ∇D_env ≈ a₀"
    advantage: "Explains MOND success in isolated galaxies (uniform D_env) AND failure in clusters (complex D_env gradients)"
    prediction: "MOND deviations correlate with local environment complexity, not just acceleration"
    
  plasma_cosmology_foundation:
  connects: "Praesto Topological Phase → Plasma State Dynamics"
  key_claim: "APT provides the missing ontological foundation for plasma cosmology by explaining how charged topological structures (knots) emerge from the primordial substrate, while plasma physics accurately describes their collective electromagnetic behavior once formed."
  mechanism:
    - "Phase_2_Structural_Ladder creates the fundamental charged particles (electrons, positrons, quarks) as topological defects"
    - "These topological charges then interact via EM force (Phase_3_Force_Emergence: 8_EM)"
    - "At sufficient density, collective plasma behavior emerges from these topological foundations"
  implication: "Plasma cosmology becomes the natural macroscopic description of APT's microscopic topological dynamics in high-energy environments"

  
pilot-wave_determinism:
  connects: "Knot Topology + Praesto Wave → Bohmian Pilot-Wave"
  key_claim: "The pilot-wave is the **local, high-coherence impedance field** generated by the knot (particle). The particle is deterministically guided by the local **minimum-resistance gradient ($\nabla Z$)** of this field."
  implication: "Restores determinism to quantum mechanics by defining particle motion as inevitable movement along the path of least Praesto resistance."
