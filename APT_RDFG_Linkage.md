## RFDG Gravitational Mechanism (APT Interpretation)

The foundational mathematics and geometric description of gravity are detailed in the earlier **Relativistic Field Density Gravity (RFDG)** work:

The **A Probable Theory (APT)** framework accounts for the RFDG effects through the following emergent process:

---

### A. Origin of the Praesto Sink (Mass)

The RFDG model requires a region of increased density in the medium to act as a gravitational source.  
In **APT**, this source is derived from the **Action-Pulse dynamics**:

- **Topological Constraint**  
  Stable matter particles (quarks, leptons) are defined as highly constrained, localized topologies (Möbius loops and oligomers).

- **Impedance and Density**  
  This topological constraint corresponds directly to a region of maximum impedance (*Zᵣ*) and therefore a maximum local density of Praesto (*ρₚᵣₐₑₛₜₒ*).

➡️ This concentration is the **“sink”** necessary for the RFDG gravitational source.

### B. Generation of the Gravitational Vortex

The gravitational vortex described by RFDG is the macroscopic, thermodynamic response to this density sink:

- **Density Gradient (∇ρₚᵣₐₑₛₜₒ)**  
  The high-density Praesto within the mass creates a steep gradient with the surrounding lower-density vacuum field.

- **Minimum Resistance Flow**  
  According to the APT *principle of minimum-resistance pathfinding*, the surrounding lower-density Praesto flows inward to equilibrate pressure — forming a continuous, vortex-like inflow.

- **Relativistic Effect**  
  Objects and energy (*τ* fields) traveling near this sink are not “pulled” by a force; instead, they follow the path of minimum resistance through the streaming, inward-flowing Praesto —  
  **mathematically equivalent to a geodesic in the curved spacetime metric** *g*₍μν₎*ᵉᶠᶠ*.

> **Summary:**  
> In APT (RDFG/Koronda), gravity is not a separate force but a hydrodynamic and impedance-driven phenomenon of the Praesto field.  
> Mass is a region of constrained topology, and spacetime curvature emerges from the pressure-gradient flow of Praesto toward that constraint.
