  connects: "Praesto Topological Phase → Plasma State Dynamics"
  role: "Provides the ontological substrate from which classical plasma physics emerges."
  
  key_claim: >
    APT offers the underlying mechanism for the appearance of charged,
    current-supporting structures (topological knots), enabling plasma
    cosmology to serve as the correct macroscopic description wherever
    collective electromagnetic behavior dominates.

  mechanism:
    - Phase_2_Structural_Ladder:
        description: "Generates stable charged particles—electrons, positrons, quarks—as quantized topological defects in Praesto."
    - Phase_3_Force_Emergence_8_EM:
        description: "Electromagnetic force arises from impedance-mediated coupling between charged topological flows."
    - Collective_Plasma_Dynamics:
        description: "At sufficient density/temperature, topological charges form EM-interacting ensembles with classical plasma behavior."

  implication: >
    Plasma cosmology becomes the natural high-energy, large-scale
    phenomenology of APT’s microscopic topological dynamics, without
    replacing standard cosmology but enriching its ontological base.
