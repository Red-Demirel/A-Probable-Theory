A Probable Theory explores a first-principles, probability-driven explanation of existence.
It proposes a dynamic substrate (Praesto), where density and impedance variations give rise
to geometry, time, and matter via the Action-Pulse mechanism.

This repository is **an open scientific collaboration** — we invite contributions that:
- Formalize the mathematical skeleton (fields, metrics, coupling functions)
- Simulate local action-pulse and impedance interactions
- Connect APT with existing physical frameworks (QFT, thermodynamics, general relativity)

---

## Core Principles
- The omniverse follows probabilities, not arbitrary constants.
- Perfect nothingness is impossible; Praesto must exist.
- Time and geometry emerge from resistance to change.
- Action-pulse defines the rhythm of existence.
