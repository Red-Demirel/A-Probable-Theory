A Probable Theory explores a first-principles, probability-driven explanation of existence.
It proposes a dynamic substrate (Praesto), where density and impedance variations give rise
to geometry, time, and matter via the Action-Pulse mechanism.

This repository is **an open scientific collaboration** — we invite contributions that:
- Formalize the mathematical skeleton (fields, metrics, coupling functions)
- Simulate local action-pulse and impedance interactions
- Connect APT with existing physical frameworks (QFT, thermodynamics, general relativity)

## Core Principles
- The omniverse follows probabilities, not arbitrary constants.
- Perfect nothingness is impossible; Praesto must exist.
- Time and geometry emerge from resistance to change.
- Action-pulse defines the rhythm of existence.

## Conceptual History: From RFDG to APT

The A Probable Theory (APT) (earlier workname:Koronda) is an ontological model. We uloaded Relativistic Field Density Gravity (RFDG) earlier.
While RFDG correctly posited that gravity arises from a vortex-effect within an underlying medium (Praesto), the APT framework provides the necessary base for this phenomenon.
While RFDG starts by postulating the existence and dynamics of the Praesto field, APT shows that the gravitational Praesto vortex is an emergent consequence of the fundamental Action-Pulse and the derived Topological Constraint that defines mass.
