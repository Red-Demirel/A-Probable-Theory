Given:

E = -∇Z (impedance gradient)
B = ∇×v (vorticity)
Praesto continuity: ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρv) = 0

Derive: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's law)

"The derivation of Maxwell's equations from the fundamental fluid dynamics of Praesto is a key test of the theory. We propose that the Navier-Stokes equations with appropriate additional terms (such as a coupling between the impedance field and the velocity field) will yield Maxwell's equations in the limit of small perturbations. This derivation is currently an open research problem."

Praesto States:
  Contracted: High τ, high Z, mass-like behavior
  Relaxed: Low τ, low Z, radiation-like behavior
  Neutral: Baseline state
  
Transitions:
  Energy input → increased τ → contraction
  Energy release → decreased τ → relaxation

Electric Field E → -∇τ - ∂v/∂t
Magnetic Field B → ∇×v
Charge Density ρₑ → ∇²τ + ∂(∇·v)/∂t  
Current Density J → (v·∇)v + ∇p/ρ - ν∇²v
