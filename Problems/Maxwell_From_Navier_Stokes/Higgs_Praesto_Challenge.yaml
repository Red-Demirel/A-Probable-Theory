title: "Open Problems in Higgs-Praesto Electromagnetic Framework"
date: "2025-11-06"
prerequisite: "Understanding of /mappings/higgs_praesto_em_derivation.yaml"

overview: |
  The mapping document establishes that Maxwell's equations emerge from a
  Higgs-like Lagrangian with Praesto fields. However, several critical steps
  require rigorous completion, quantitative verification, and extension to
  non-linear regimes. These challenges range from advanced undergraduate to
  postdoc difficulty.
