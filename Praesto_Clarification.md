## Clarification on Praesto and Established Physics

Modern physics already assumes a dynamic, space-filling substrate—not as a hypothesis, but as a functional necessity:

    Quantum Field Theory (QFT) treats every particle and force as an excitation of a continuous quantum field permeating all space.

    Cosmology invokes dark energy as a uniform background density that acts everywhere simultaneously, countering gravitational collapse through an instantaneous expansive effect.

    Quantum mechanics depends on vacuum fluctuations and virtual particle exchanges—processes that require an active, responsive medium.

Yet these models describe the same reality using fragmented concepts.

Praesto, within APT, does not invent a new entity. It names the obvious: a single, coherent, reactive medium that physics already uses in practice. It eliminates semantic confusion—no obsolete “ether,” no contradiction—just the logical and ontological substrate implicit in all modern theories.

Praesto unifies:

    Local impedance and density variations in this medium give rise to mass, energy, and gravitation.

    Field excitations, dark energy, and vacuum effects become natural behaviors of one underlying system.

Reality emerges by resolving uncertainty in the most probable way — and Praesto is the medium through which that resolution occurs, from Planck scale to cosmos.
