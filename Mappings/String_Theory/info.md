Goal: Map string theory mathematical structures to Praesto topological configurations
Key Questions:
- How do Calabi-Yau manifolds emerge from Praesto density variations?
- What is the physical interpretation of D-branes in APT?
- How do dualities reflect different observational perspectives on the same topology?
