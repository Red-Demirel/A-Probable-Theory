praesto_identity: "∮ Z · dA = n × Z₀ ħ"

lqg_interpretation:
  flux: "edge piercing knot surface"
  area_quantum: "n × 4π l_Pl²"
  charge_link: "same n as QFT winding"

note: |
  **This is the *same math* as QFT.**  
  Only the language changes:  
  - QFT: `ψ(x)` circles → **charge**  
  - LQG: edge flux → **area**  
  - Praesto: both = **impedance through knot**
