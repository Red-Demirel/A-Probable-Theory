difficulty: "graduate_level"

overview: |
  This mapping demonstrates how Maxwell's equations emerge from a Higgs-like
  Lagrangian formulation where the Higgs field represents the Praesto substrate's
  action-impedance complex, and gauge fields correspond to action-velocity potentials.
  
  Key insight: EM is the local linear response of Praesto to topological constraints,
  mathematically identical to the Higgs mechanism but with different physical interpretation.
