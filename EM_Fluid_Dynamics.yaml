maxwell_from_fluid:
  - standard: "∇·E = ρ/ε₀"
    praesto: "∇·(∇Z) = Δρ"
    meaning: "charge = laplacian of impedance"
  - standard: "∇·B = 0"
    praesto: "∇·(∇×v) = 0"
    meaning: "magnetic flow is divergenceless"
  - standard: "∇×E = -∂B/∂t"
    praesto: "∇×(∇Z) = -∂(∇×v)/∂t"
    meaning: "changing flow induces impedance curl"
  - standard: "∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t"
    praesto: "∇×(∇×v) = μ₀J + ∂(∇Z)/∂t"
    meaning: "flow curl = current + impedance change"

historical_context:
  - "Not new in spirit" 
  - "But Praesto makes it *physical*, *local*, *quantized*, and *unified*"
  - "No dragged aether — just reactive substrate"

summary:
  one_liner: "EM isn’t fundamental — it’s Praesto in motion: E = slope, B = swirl, light = ripple, charge = knot."
  blog_hook: "Maxwell’s equations aren’t laws. They’re fluid dynamics."
  tweet: "EM = fluid flow in Praesto. Same math. One medium. #APT"
